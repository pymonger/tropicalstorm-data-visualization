    "As a native of the Hawaiian Islands, Iâ€™ve lived through two hurricanes, Hurricane Iwa in 1982 and Hurricane Iniki in 1992, with a 10-year span between their occurrences. Since 1992, there have been a number of hurricanes that have come close to the islands but none that have made an impact like that of Iwa with a damage cost of \\$773 million dollars or Iniki with a damage cost of \\$3.2 billion dollars (both adjusted to 2006 dollars based on U.S. Department of Commerce Implicit Price Deflator for Construction) (Eric S. Blake, 2007). In contrast, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma ravaged the states of Texas and Florida and the US territory of Puerto Rico in one year, 2017, and it has been estimated that the economic cost of these hurricanes will exceed \\$150 billion (Horowitz, 2017). Is the occurrence of two or more costly hurricanes hitting the same US region within the same season a rare phenomenon? Or does it occur more often than not? To investigate, I will use the IBTrACKS (International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship) dataset to perform statistical analysis that will hopefully shed some light on these questions."
